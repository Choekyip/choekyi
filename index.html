         The First thing I heard waking up is my mom vacuuming the upstairs hallway. My name is Jigme Wangchuk, a teenage boy in his last year of high school. I live with my two parents and my two sisters. My parents are computer science pros. My two sister's names are Methok and Dakar. I am two years older than Methok and one minute older than Dakar. So me and Dakar are twin siblings. Me and my twin sister are oppisite in personality. I like to keep everything to myself and she likes to blab about everything, but we have one thing in common. We both love computer science!  </p>

            <h2>üìç Starting of my day </h2> 
            <p> After brushing my teeth and changing I go down stairs for breakfast to see my two sisters and parents already eating breakfast. I made myself some cerial and sat down mom was smiling and said "Guess what dakar's friend Sophie texted her that there gonna be a coumputer science comition the winner gets a full scholar ship"!"Yeah but you don't need to join because you shold know i'am gonna win" said Dakar. Just so you know Sophie is the princibles daughter and Dakars best friend. So Sophie gets to know this kinda stuff llike one week before us normal students are told.  </p> 
            </p> 
            <p> 
           Ofcourse I am totally gonna join but I won't tell Dakar yet at least. After Breakfast I grab my backpack put on my shoes and wait for my two sisters yeah they take another 10 minutes! Once they are finally ready we walk to the bus stop and the rest of the way to school is a breeze. Once I got to shool I headed straight to my homeroom class I always like to be in class first. But then there was A annountcement and everyone in 12th grade had to go to the aditoriam.  </p>

            <h2>The announcement</h2> 
            <p> As soon as I enter the auditoriam I know why 12th grade was called. What I saw was The college logo I was so exided I smiled all the way to a seat with the best view. Usually when the 12th grade has to go to the aditoriam it's boring but today it was different! </p> 
            <p> "Good morning students we have a special guest today meet the head of st. cloud state university" said Mrs.Brown the principal. " Hello Students my name is Emma Jones but you can call me Mrs.Jones I am here to announce A coding compition in this school you will compete for a full scholar ship on codinng"! "There will be a preliminary round and final round your homeroom teachers will give you a sheet to sighn needed with also extra information the sighn will be due on Wednesday"."all right students that is all you may now go to your homeroom that is all".

            <h2>The sabotage</h2> 
            <p> After That school when of as a breeze as soon as I got of the bus I didn't even wait for my sister. I just ran all the way home grabed A few snacks well actully mabey more than a few but I grabed and left strait to my room. I then starded reading the information sheet the Mrs.Jones was talking about. I saw the compition was this Friday I immediately sighn the paper not noticing Dakar was right next to me face red. Once I noticed her I said "Don't you know how to knok" "Well so you are sighning up I told you I'am gonna win so it's no use" said Dakar."Your acting like your better at coding than me I don't have a coding tuter coming in 4 pm two times a week". </p> <p> "It's not my fault mom and dad have work" said Dakar. "Well I taught myself so should you be able to as well anyway did you finish that homework Choekyi told you to do". " Oh yeah still got a line to finish you should still know I am winning so you should quit while your ahead". Yeah no thank you I won't quit oh yeah just so you know choekyi is the tutor she likes us to call her by her first name thought. Well at least she shut the door behind her so I practiced every day and of course I gave the sighned paper back of course. then the day before the compition Methok called me in privatly in her room. "Brother I heard Dakar on the phone with Sophie taking about paying someone to "accidentlly" spilling some water on your computer". "I also heard Sophie saying there are no back up computers and the registration is full so there won't be any computers so ofcourse I recorded it all".
