         The First thing I heard waking up is my mom vacuuming the upstairs hallway. My name is Jigme Wangchuk, a teenage boy in his last year of high school. I live with my two parents and my two sisters. My parents are computer science pros. My two sister's names are Methok and Dakar. I am two years older than Methok and one minute older than Dakar. So me and Dakar are twin siblings. Me and my twin sister are oppisite in personality. I like to keep everything to myself and she likes to blab about everything, but we have one thing in common. We both love computer science!  </p>

            <h2>üìç Starting of my day </h2> 
            <p> After brushing my teeth and changing I go down stairs for breakfast to see my two sisters and parents already eating breakfast. I made myself some cerial and sat down mom was smiling and said "Guess what dakar's friend Sophie texted her that there gonna be a coumputer science comition the winner gets a full scholar ship"!"Yeah but you don't need to join because you shold know i'am gonna win" said Dakar. Just so you know Sophie is the princibles daughter and Dakars best friend. So Sophie gets to know this kinda stuff llike one week before us normal students are told.  </p> 
            </p> 
            <p> 
           Ofcourse I am gonna join but I won't tell Dakar yet at least. After Breakfast I grab my backpack put on my shoes and wait for my two sisters yeah they take another 10 minutes! Once they are finally ready we walk to the bus stop and the rest of the way to school is a breeze. Once I got to shool I headed straight to my homeroom class I always like to be in class first. But then there was A annountcement and everyone in 12th grade had to go to the aditoriam.  </p>

            <h2>‚õ∞Ô∏è Dharamsala</h2> 
            <p> After fleeing into exile in 1959, the Dalai Lama established the Tibetan government-in-exile in Dharamsala, India. Though outside Tibet‚Äôs borders, Dharamsala has become a third symbolic capital ‚Äî a refuge where culture, language, and faith continue to flourish against all odds. </p> <p> From this hillside town, generations of Tibetans in exile have preserved their identity, taught their history, and sustained a vision of return. Dharamsala stands as a global reminder that while Tibet‚Äôs land may be occupied, its spirit remains unbroken. </p>

        <h2></h2>
        <p> From the sacred heights of Yumbhulhagang in the Yarlung Valley to the grandeur of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet‚Äôs historical journey reflects a profound evolution ‚Äî from mythic beginnings to a unified kingdom grounded in spiritual leadership and cultural identity. The 7th-century move to Lhasa under King Songtsen Gampo marked a turning point in Tibet‚Äôs political and religious life, with the Potala becoming a lasting symbol of that union. Today, as the map traces these historic paths, it also points beyond ‚Äî to Dharamsala in exile, where the spirit of Tibet continues to thrive through memory, resistance, and renewal. </p>
